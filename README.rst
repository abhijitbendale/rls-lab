Notes:
============


The linear RLS code works fine in python

data/smd.mat is a random matrix generated which was used for benchmarking purposes
The linear RLS gives the same output as Ryan Rifkin's matlab code

Example 1
-----------
python rls_pipeline.py data/smp.mat out --rls_type linear



The non-linear RLS has problems:
The eigenvalues generated by linalg.eig function gives flipped values as 
compared to the ones obtained by matlab's eig() function
