function [ws,loos,bestlambdas] = lrlsloobest(X, Y, lambdas)
% Wrapper around lrlsloo that gives only the w and LOO for the
% "best" lambda (lowest LOO) for each rhs.  Also returns the
% best lambda.
%
% See lrlsloo for more in-depth explanations of parameter settings.
%
% If X is n by d and Y is n by cl, then ws is d by cl and loos is 
% cl by 1.
